Hello My name is Ethan Zhou. I am a PhD student in University of Pittsburgh supervised by Prof Shandong Wu. Before University of Pittsburgh, I received my master degree in Northwestern University.

My research mainly focues on Medical image, using Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. Broadly spreaking, I study how AI models empower and aid doctors to diagnosis the breast cancer, skin cancer, bone fractures, etc, how AI models can be used for predicting the risk of certain diseases.
